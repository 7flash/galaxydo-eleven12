Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes.\n\nIn short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. \n\nAn understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.",

      "originalText": "This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which were old Hermetic axioms. \n\nIt explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. \n\nIt explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. \n\nTo illustrate: Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. \n\nLook at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins! \n\nThe two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. \n\nSo \"heat\" and \"cold\" are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. \n\nThe same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes.\n\nIn short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters. \n\nAn understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art."

      "originalText": "This Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\"\n\nIt explains that THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. \n\nIt also explains that all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" \n\nThis Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. \n\nAn understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to apply the same to his well-being and advancement."
